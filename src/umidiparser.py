DESCRIPTION
    This module allows to parse midi files.
    This module does not contain a sound synthesizer, only the capabilities to
    read and interpret a midi file.
    Example:

    import umidiparser
    Import utime
    for event in umidiplay.MidiFile("example.mid"):
        utime.sleep_us( event.delta_us )
        if event.status == umidiplay.NOTE_ON:
            ... start the note event.note on event.channel with event.velocity
        elif event.status == umidiplay.NOTE_OFF :
            ... stop the note event.note stop to sound ...
        elif event.status == umidiplay.PROGRAM_CHANGE:
            ... change midi program to event.program on event.channel ....
        else:
            print("other event", event )

# Change log: v1.2
#   Added CircuitPython compatibility
#   Removed use of os.path.abspath, does not exist in micropython/circuitpython
#   Renamed time functions "ticks_now_us", "ticks_diff_us" to "time_now_us", "time_diff_us"
#   Changed decode from meta event data for compatibility with all Python versions, now only
#   ascii is decoded.
#   New method MidiTrack.play, removed track_number parameter.
#   Corrected possible error if playing open file again
#   Added event.is_channel() to test for channel events
#   Allow MidiFile.play() used in async for (with asyncio.sleep instead of sleep). Requires asyncio
#   Play funcion computes event.timestamp_us for each event
# Change log: v1.3
#   For CircuitPython, it's import asyncio. Also time_now_us now returns an integer.
