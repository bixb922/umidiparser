# MIDI over serial output with ESP32 and MicroPython

# Contents

# Overview

MIDI data can be sent over a serial connection. This is done with 5 pin DIN connectors:

![MIDI DIN connector](MIDI_DIN.png)

This document explains how to play MIDI files on a ESP32 and drive a sound module with a 5 pin DIN MIDI connector.

All this is valid both for the ESP32 and the ESP32-S3 microcontrollers.

# Parts list

* One 33 Ohm resistor
* One 10 Ohm resistor
* One 5 pin 180ยบ DIN male connector

You also can connect the ESP32 to a female connector and use a 5 pin DIN male to male cable to connect to the sound module.


# MIDI over serial line DIN connector

The MIDI signal over a DIN connector needs no current (0 mA) for a logical 1 and 5 mA for a logical 0.

Since the serial protocol is normally on (i.e. transmitting logical 1), current is zero while idle.

The signal is transmitted through pins 4 and 5 of the 5 pin DIN connector. This is valid both for male and female connectors. Here is a front view, i.e. looking into the connectors:

# Circuit

The circuit to connect to MIDI out is this:

![schematics](schematic.png)

It's based on the circuit in the MIDI standard, see [MIDI CA-033 standard](#midi-ca-033-standard).

You need to connect the GPIO output pin of the ESP32 to Rc = 10 Ohm and then to the pin 5 of the DIN connector, and the 3.3V pin of the ESP32 to the Ra = 33 Ohm pin and to the pin 4 of the DIN connector.

No additional buffer, driver or voltage shifter is needed. The ESP32 GPIO pins supply more than enough energy to make this work.

Pins 1, 2 and 3 of the MIDI plug are not connected. Pin 2 and shielding is needed if cables are long, see the [MIDI CA-033 standard](#midi-ca-033-standard).


# The program

To play back a MIDI file, use this MicroPython code on the ESP32. For the example, the MIDI file needs to be on the root of the ESP32's file system.
```
from machine import UART
from umidiparser import MidiFile

uart = UART( 1, baudrate=31250, tx=10, rx=9 )

# Turn off all notes that still might be on
for channel in range(16):
    # 0xb0=Control Change, 120=All sound off 
    uart.write(bytes([0xb0+channel, 120])) 

# Send all channel events to the MIDI output.
# .play() will wait until the note is due.
for event in MidiFile("my_midi_file.mid").play():
    if event.is_channel():
        uart.write( event.to_midi() )
```

Don't use UART0, it is reserved for the REPL. See the [MicroPython docs](#micropython-esp32-docs) for the default pins for UART 1 and 2, but you can select almost any pin. For MIDI out, the rx pin is not used but is it reserved anyhow.


# The receiving end

This is the receiving end of the circuit (i.e. this is what's behind a ```MIDI in```plug):

![receiving circuit](receiving.png)

There is always Rb, a 220 Ohm resistor on the receiving end to limit current. The diode D1 kicks in when pin 4 and 5 are accidentally reversed to protect the LED, i.e. reversing pins 4 and 5 accidentally does no damage to either end. The current drives LED1 in a optocoupler. The purpose of the optocoupler is to isolate this circuit electrically from the rest of the receiver. The optocouplers are normally 6N138, 6N139, PC-900V or H11L1 integrated circuits.

When LED1 has a current of around 5 mA, it will act on a photosensitive device that then switches a current on and off in the receiver.


# Some tinkering

## ESP32 GPIO pin drive strength

The ESP32 pins allow to set the drive strength:

| drive= | maximum current | internal resistance
|--------|-----------------|--------------------|
| ```Pin.DRIVE_0```| 5mA | 130 ohm|
| ```Pin.DRIVE_1```| 10mA | 60 ohm|
| ```Pin.DRIVE_2```| 20mA | 30 ohm (default strength if not configured)|
| ```Pin.DRIVE_3```| 40mA | 15 ohm|

The equivalent circuit modeling the drive strength is as follows:

![equivalent](equivalent.png)

The equivalent circuit is drawn for logical 0, i.e. current is flowing. The typical voltage drop on LED1 is 1.4V and D1 is open (not shown here), so the circuit equation is:

(R<sub>drive</sub> + R<sub>a</sub> + R<sub>c</sub> + R<sub>b</sub>)&times;_I_ + V<sub>LED1</sub> = 3.3

Solving for the current _I_, and setting V<sub>LED1</sub> = 1.4, R<sub>b</sub>=220Ohm

_I_ = 1.9/(R<sub>drive</sub> + R<sub>a</sub> + R<sub>c</sub> + 220)

Here is a little table with the current _I_ for various drive strength and resistors, all with a typical value 1.4V of V<sub>LED1</sub>:

R<sub>a</sub>|R<sub>c</sub>  |Drive|R<sub>drive</sub>|_I_ [mA]|
--|----|-|--|---|
33|10  |2|30|6.5|
33|10  |3|15|6.8|
50|50  |2|30|5.4|
50|50  |3|15|5.7|
100|100|2|30|4.2|
100|100|3|15|4.4|

I found that R<sub>a</sub>=R<sub>c</sub>=100 Ohm and drive=3 works for my case and offers more protection than 33+10 Ohm. I think that those values should work for almost all MIDI devices.

To set the drive strength, this is the MicroPython code:
```
from machine import UART, Pin
uart = UART( 1, baudrate=31250, tx=Pin(10,Pin.OUT,drive=Pin.DRIVE_3), rx=9 )
```

## Testing

Here is my test setup. I have a (very old) Yamaha QY100 sound module which I used for testing. The microcontroller is a ESP32-S3 on a DEVKIT-C board. Just for precaution, I used an suspect ESP32-S3 too, but I didn't burn anything in the process &#128540;

![circuit](circuit.jpg)

Wiring goes from pin 10 to the blue 100 Ohm resistor, then to pin 4 (orange) of the DIN connector, pin 5 (white) to the other blue 100 Ohm resistor and (red) back to 3.3V of the microcontroller's board. No special setup was necessary on the QY100, but it has a sliding switch to select the MIDI source which had to be set to MIDI.

So now the sound module is playing back a nice march! (One of my crank organ MIDI files) &#x1F603;&#x1F603;&#x1F603;

## And what happens with a logical 0?

Just for completeness: when the signal is logical 1, the GPIO pin shows a voltage of 3.25V. The current will be always at most (3.25-3.3)/220=-0.2mA and thus be slightly negative through LED1, so no light will be produced and the optocoupler will turn off. The optocouplers can handle a reverse voltage up to 5 or 6V, so this is perfectly within specs, and D1 limits the voltage at LED1 to about 0.8V anyhow.

# Other stuff

MIDI connections are designed to be very sturdy and to resist a lot of abuse. On stage, but also in a studio, many bad things can happen...

These situations work well with this circuit:
* If you plug in this ```MIDI out``` to another ```MIDI out``` instead to a ```MIDI in```, nothing bad will happen, as long as the other ```MIDI out```is idle.
* If pins 4 and 5 get accidentally reversed, nothing bad will happen. D1 will absorb the reversed current nicely.


These situations should be avoided:
* If you plug this circuit to a ```MIDI out``` by error, and if the other ```MIDI out``` starts to transmit, 5V might leak back to the ESP32 and there is no protection for that.
* If pins 4 and 5 get accidentally shorted, and the ESP32 starts to transmit, the current that will flow is about 60 mA which is too high for the ESP32. That's why I prefer slightly higher resistors.
* If you use long MIDI cables, see the [MIDI CA-033 standard](#midi-ca-033-standard) for shielding and use of pin 2 to get protection against RFI (Radio Frequency Interference).

The ESP32 pins also have a open drain mode, but I think there is no important advantage in using this mode.


# Troubleshooting

* Make sure pin 4 and 5 are not reversed
* Check all connections again
* Make sure baud rate is 31250
* Make sure that it's the correct pin number (the silk screen number on the DEVKIT board)

To measure the circuit, this little MicroPython program helps:
```
from machine import Pin
upin = Pin(10, mode=Pin.OUT)
while True:
    print("111111111111111")
    upin.value(1)
    time.sleep(5)
    print("0")
    upin.value(0)
    time.sleep(5)
```
This will alternate on and off states with enough time for a cheap digital multimeter (as the one I have) to settle. The program will do no harm to the ```MIDI in``` on the sound module.

To measure the current that is flowing, you can measure the voltage at R<sub>c</sub> and divide that by the resistor value. With a 10 Ohm resistor, the reading should alternate between 0 mV (for a logical 1) and 0.05V (50 mV, for a logical 0). With a 100 Ohm resistor, the reading should switch between 0 mV and 0.5V (500 mV).

The voltage between the output pin and ground (GND) should switch between about 3.25V and 0.15V.

# Is this possible on a RP2040?

I haven't tried it. The RP2040 has a maximum current of 4mA per pin, and here 5mA are needed, so the current must be limited with higher resistances.

This article shows how to set the RP2040 to a higher current, similar to the drive= parameter on the ESP32 pins:

https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberrypipico/comments/10zbe89/micropython_drive_strength_for_gpio/

That post says that "the pad control registers start at 0x4001c000 and can be manipulated using mem32. See page 299 in the datasheet. The following sets pin 16 to 12ma drive: ```mem32[0x4001c044] = mem32[0x4001c044] | 0b0110000```

With a drive current of 8ma or 12ma, it should be possible to make the circuit work.
